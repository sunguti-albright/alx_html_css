# CSS Advanced — Figma-based Landing Page

This folder contains the project files for the **CSS Advanced** assignment (Figma-based landing page).

## Overview / Objectives

Recreate the landing page UI from the provided Figma file using **only** HTML, CSS and minimal JavaScript (if needed). Focus is on CSS styling and responsive behavior.

You will implement:
- Header & Banner
- Quotes section
- Video list (grid)
- Membership cards
- FAQ section
- Footer

All files must be W3C valid and end with a newline. Do **not** use frameworks (Bootstrap, React, etc.) or external CSS libraries.

## Files

- `index.html` — page skeleton and markup for the sections listed above.
- `styles.css` — styles for layout and design. Import this in `index.html`.
- `images/` — place images you download from the Figma assets here (logo, banner image, speaker thumbnails, video thumbnails).

## Assets / Figma

Figma design: `https://www.figma.com/design/6NGAYjCYRPIylTotwNYvl2/Homepage--Copy-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=7IgL4OCfbdlGkwXe-0`

Download images for this project using the Figma prototype (or the provided assets zip). Put images into `images/` and reference them in the HTML (examples already point to `images/`).

Fonts used in the design (optional):
- `Source Sans Pro` — can be loaded with Google Fonts if you wish to match typography exactly.
- `Spin Cycle OT` — if unavailable, use a close system fallback.

## How to use

1. Place `index.html` and `styles.css` in this folder.
2. Create an `images/` subfolder and add the image assets.
3. Open `index.html` in a browser and adjust `styles.css` to match the Figma values.

## Notes & Tips

- Keep CSS selectors simple and semantic. Avoid over-specific selectors.
- Use CSS variables for colors & spacing to quickly adapt the design.
- Fonts and pixel-perfect spacing may differ across machines — prioritize layout and responsiveness, then adjust exact values.
- Validate your HTML and CSS with the W3C validators.

Good luck — if you want I can also extract images from a Zip you upload and drop them into `images/` for you.
